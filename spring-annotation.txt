@SpringBootApplication
Spring Boot @SpringBootApplication annotation is used to mark a configuration class that declares one or more @Bean methods and also triggers auto-configuration and component scanning. 


@RestController
Spring 4.0 introduced the @RestController annotation in order to simplify the creation of RESTful web services. Itâ€™s a convenient annotation that combines @Controller and @ResponseBody, which eliminates the need to annotate every request handling method of the controller class with the @ResponseBody annotation.
